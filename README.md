# Connect 4 - Usacity C++ Project

## How to Play
Players 1 and 2 take turns dropping disks into the empty slots. The first player to have four disks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins!

Use the left and right keys to move your disk and press the space bar to drop the disk into an empty slot!

Press the escape key to quit early.
